/t MCAT Kaplan Ch 3: Embryogenesis and Development;


secondary oocyte -(fertilization)-> zygote -(cleavage)-> embryo -(more divisions)-> morula -(blastulation)-> blastula -(implantation and more divisions)-> gastrula -(three germ layers form)-> -(neurulation)-> -(8 weeks after fertilization)-> fetus


=Early Dev Stages=
secondary oocyte ovulated from follicle ~day 14
travels to fallopian tube, where fertilized up to 24 hrs after ovulation usually at the ampula
	/v ampula; /def widest part of fallopian tube

if fertilized:
	sperm releases acrosomal enzymes, penetrate corona radiata & zona pelucida
	once contact oocyte cell membrane, forms acrosomal apparatus: extends to and penetrates cell membrane
		pronucleus can now enter oocyte
	/v cortical reaction; occurs
		/def calcium ions released causing membrane depolarization
		two purposes:
			prevents multiple fertilization
			increased metabolic rate;

once fertilized, is now referred to as a /v zygote; /def fertilized egg;

==Twins==

	placenta may fuse but nothing else is shared, NOT genetically similar

/v monozygotic; /v identical; /def zygote that split in two;
	/! compare to: dizygotic, fraternal
	identical genomes
	conjoined twins may form if incomplete division
	classified by shared structures: (mono/di)(chorionic/amnionic)
		note to self: can it be dichorionic/monoamnionic or does amnion forms before chorion?

twinning type epends on when separation occurs

=Cleavage=
zygote travels to uterus for implantation
	if too late, no endometerium
while moing to uterus, does /v cleavage; /def rapid mitotis of zygote/embryo
	increases nuclear-to-cytoplasmic and surface area-to-volume ratios
		better gas, nutrient exchange;

		/! attraction: cosmetic features and smarts
	/v mesoderm; /def forms musculoskeletal, circulatory, excretory, gonads, muscular and connective tissue of digestive and respiratory systems, adrenal cortex. 
		/! "means" of getting around
	/v endoderm; /def epithelial linings of digestive and respiratory tracts, lungs, pancreas, thyroid, bladder, distal urinary tract, parts of liver.
		/! linngs of "endernal" organs

differentiation accomplished by selective transcription
	/v induction; /def ability of group of cells to influence fate of nearby cells
		mediated by /v inducers; /def diffuse from organizing to responsive cells; 
			function /ex guidance of neural axons;

=Neurulation= 
/v neurulation; /def development of the nervous system;
	occurs after 3 germ layers formed
	recall: derived from ectoderm
	notochord (mesodermal cells) forms --> neural folds/groove in the neural plate 
	neural crest cells --> PNS, sensory ganglia, auto ganglia, adrenal medulla, Schwann cells, cell types in other tissues too
	ectodermal cells migrate to cover growing NS

=Problems=
highly sensitive time
/v teratogens; /def substances that interfere w/ dev; /ex alcohol, prescription drugs, pathogens, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
can cause defects, deaths
sugar overexposure --> too large, hypoglycemia (b/c high insulin levels as compensation for previous high sugar)
folic acid deficiency --> prevent complete closure of neural tube --> spina bifida, anencephaly
unpredictable, variable, multifactory

=Mechanisms of Dev=
/v determination; /def commmitment of cell to particular function, lineage;
	may be caused by: 
		uneven mRNA, protein distribution (during cleavage)
		secretion of morphogens by nearby molecules
/v differentiation; /def changes in struct/funct/biochem to match new cell type; /vs determination;

/!
	/v umbilical arteries; /def carry blood away from fetus, towards placenta;
	/v umbilical vein; /def carries blood towards fetus, from placenta;

	nutrient/waste xchange occur at placenta
	both sensitive to high blood pressure: three shunts actively direct blood away
		/v foramen ovale; /def one-way valve, connects right atrium to left atrium;
			allows right atrium --> left atrium, instead of --> right ventricle
			unlike in adult, right side is at higher pressure than left side
			birth: pressure diff reverses, foramen ovale suts
		/v ductus arteriosus; /def shunts leftover blood from pulmonary artery to aorta;
		/v ductus venosus; /defe shunts blood from placenta to inferior vena cava (instead of liver);
			liver still receives blood from smaller haltic arteries

=gestation, birth=

larger animal ~= larger gestational period

/v first trimester; /def major organ development, heart beats, becomes fetus, 9cm long;
/v second trimester; /def fetus grows a lot, toes/fingers/human appearance, 30-36cm long;

birth: /! prostoglandins and oxytocin coordinate rhythmic contractions;
	1 cervix thins out and amniotic sac ruptures: water breaking
	2 strong uterine contractions --> birth
	3 placenta and umbilical cord expelled: afterbirth
