Description:
A source to source compiler to convert between Damon's language to LaTeX source.
Damon's language aims to serve as a quick notetaking language for use by students
in lecture.

Design goals for Language:
1. Very similar to standard shorthand notetaking
2. Common sense syntax

Design goals for Compiler:
1. Code optimization is not required.
2. Will need to convert Damon source to AST, then to LaTeX.
