# Damon-slanguage
First attempt at making a custom LaTeX package. This package is intended to assist students with notetaking by altering LaTeX tags to ones more amenable to notetaking.

User-inputted markup will allow for generation of content like an outlined summary, importable vocabulary cards, index and glossary. In the future we may move towards interactive HTML documents.

Overall, the goals of this project are to make (1) note-taking faster, (2) note-reading less ambiguous and (3) extraction of certain elements (like vocabulary words) much easier.
