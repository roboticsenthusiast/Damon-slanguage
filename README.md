# Damon-slanguage

A source to source compiler to convert between Damon's language to LaTeX source.
Damon's language aims to serve as a quick notetaking language for use by students
in lecture. User-inputted markup will allow for generation of content like an outlined summary, importable vocabulary cards, index and glossary.
In the future we may move towards interactive HTML documents.

Overall, the goals of this project are to:
(1) make note-taking faster
(2) make note-reading less ambiguous  
(3) make extraction of certain elements (like vocabulary words) much easier.
