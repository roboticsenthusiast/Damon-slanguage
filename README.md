# Damon-slanguage

A source to source compiler to convert from Damon's language to LaTeX.
Damon's language aims to serve as a easy to use markup language students
in lecture. User-input will allow for generation of content like an outlined summary, importable vocabulary cards, an index and a glossary.
In the future we may move towards interactive HTML documents.

Overall, the goals of this project are to:
(1) make note-taking faster
(2) make note-reading less ambiguous  
(3) make extraction of certain elements (like vocabulary words) much easier.
